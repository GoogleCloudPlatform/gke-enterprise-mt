# Contributing

This document provides guidelines for contributing to the module. While this
module was generated from
[terraform-google-module-template](https://github.com/terraform-google-modules/terraform-google-module-template/),
it is slightly different than other Cloud Foundation Toolkit modules, and we
have tried to highlight the differences in the discussion below.

## Dependencies

The following dependencies must be installed on the development system:

- [Docker Engine][docker-engine]
- [Google Cloud SDK][google-cloud-sdk]
- [make]

## Integration Testing

Integration tests are used to verify the behaviour of the root module,
submodules, and example modules. Additions, changes, and fixes should
be accompanied with tests.

The integration tests are run using [Kitchen][kitchen],
[Kitchen-Terraform][kitchen-terraform], and [InSpec][inspec]. These
tools are packaged within a Docker image for convenience.

The general strategy for these tests is to verify the behaviour of the
[example modules](./examples/), thus ensuring that the root module,
submodules, and example modules are all functionally correct.

### Test Environment
The easiest way to test the module is in an isolated test project. The setup for such a project is defined in [test/setup](./test/setup/) directory.

To use this setup, you need a service account with these permissions (on a Folder or Organization):
- Project Creator
- Project Billing Manager
- Folder Admin
The service account also needs to be Billing Account Adminstrator (from Billing
Account Management > Permissions).


The project that the service account belongs to must have the following APIs enabled (the setup won't
create any resources on the service account's project):
- Cloud Resource Manager
- Cloud Billing
- Service Usage
- Identity and Access Management (IAM)
- Kubernetes Engine API

Export the Service Account credentials to your environment like so:

```
export SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON=$(< credentials.json)
```

You will also need to set a few environment variables:
```
export TF_VAR_org_id="your_org_id"
export TF_VAR_folder_id="your_folder_id"
export TF_VAR_billing_account="your_billing_account_id"
export TF_VAR_prefix="prefix-for-project-names"
```

With these settings in place, you can prepare a test project using Docker:
```
make docker_test_prepare
```

### Noninteractive Execution

Run `make docker_test_integration` to test all of the example modules
noninteractively, using the prepared test project.

### Interactive Execution

1. Run `make docker_run` to start the testing Docker container in
   interactive mode.

1. Run `kitchen_do create <EXAMPLE_NAME>` to initialize the working
   directory for an example module. `kitchen_do list` will show the
   kitchen-specific names of testable modules.

1. Run `kitchen_do converge <EXAMPLE_NAME>` to apply the example module.

1. Run `kitchen_do verify <EXAMPLE_NAME>` to test the example module.

1. Run `kitchen_do destroy <EXAMPLE_NAME>` to destroy the example module
   state. Note this does not work consistently due to VPC project liens.

## Linting and Formatting

Many of the files in the repository can be linted or formatted to
maintain a standard of quality.

### Execution

Run `make docker_test_lint`.
